### Setup## üåü The Mission: Democratizing Voice AI



1.  **Clone:**The ability to create AI that can hold a natural, real-time conversation over the phone is a game-changer. But until now, this power has been locked behind expensive, proprietary, and high-latency cloud APIs.

    ```sh

    git clone https://github.com/OpenVoiceX/Voice-Marketing-Agent.git**Voice Marketing Agents** changes that.

    cd Voice-Marketing-Agent

    ```This project provides a complete, end-to-end, open-source solution for anyone to build and deploy their own voice AI agents. It's not just a demo; it's a production-ready foundation designed for performance, control, and infinite customizability. Whether you're a developer wanting to automate business tasks, a hobbyist exploring conversational AI, or a student learning full-stack development, this project is for you.



2.  **Configure `.env`:****This project is our submission for GSSoC '24**, built to showcase the power of a modern, open-source AI stack.

    ```env

    # App  ### The Life of a Single Conversational Turn

    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

    AUDIO_DIR=/app/audio_files  1.  **Telephony Gateway (External):** A VoIP service (like a self-hosted Asterisk server) handles the actual phone call connection. When it's the AI's turn to speak or listen, the VoIP server makes a webhook call to our backend.

    PUBLIC_URL=http://your-server:8000  2.  **Audio Ingestion:** The VoIP server sends the user's speech as a `.wav` file in a `multipart/form-data` request to the `/webhook` endpoint of our **FastAPI Backend**.

    ```  3.  **STT Micro-Task (Speech-to-Text):**

      *   The backend receives the audio file.

3.  **Launch:**      *   It calls the `STTService`, which is powered by **`faster-whisper`**.

    ```sh      *   Using the `tiny.en` model with `int8` quantization on the CPU, it transcribes the audio to text in a few hundred milliseconds.

    docker compose up --build -d  4.  **LLM Micro-Task (Reasoning & Response Generation):**

    ```      *   The transcribed text is passed to the `LLMService`.

      *   This service constructs a prompt (including system instructions and conversation history) and sends it to the **Ollama** container.

4.  **Access:**      *   The **`TinyLlama`** model, running inside Ollama, generates the text for the agent's response, typically in under a second.

    - Dashboard: `http://localhost:3000`  5.  **TTS Micro-Task (Text-to-Speech):**

    - API Docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`      *   The LLM's text response is sent to the `TTSService`.

      *   The **`Coqui TTS`** engine synthesizes this text into a high-quality audio waveform.

---      *   The resulting audio is saved as a temporary file accessible by the backend.

  6.  **Webhook Response:** The FastAPI backend responds to the initial webhook request from the Telephony Gateway, providing a URL to the newly generated audio file. The gateway then plays this audio to the user over the phone.

## üéØ Choosing Your LLM Provider

  This entire end-to-end process is optimized to complete in **under 2 seconds**, which is crucial for maintaining a natural conversational rhythm.

| **Frontend**   | **React & Vite**                              | **Speed & Simplicity.** React provides a robust component model, while Vite offers a lightning-fast development server and optimized builds for a lightweight dashboard. |

## üíñ Contributing| **Backend**    | **Python & FastAPI**                          | **Asynchronous Performance.** FastAPI's async/await syntax is perfect for I/O-bound AI tasks, preventing the server from blocking while models are processing. |

| **STT Engine** | **`faster-whisper` (`tiny.en`)**              | **Extreme Speed.** A CTranslate2 re-implementation of Whisper that's up to 4x faster on CPU. `tiny.en` is all we need for high-accuracy English transcription. |

We love contributions!

| **TTS Engine** | **`Coqui TTS` (VITS Model)**                  | **Quality & Flexibility.** Coqui's VITS models offer a fantastic balance between natural-sounding, human-like voice and fast synthesis speeds on CPU. |

---| **Database**   | **PostgreSQL**                                | **Reliability.** A battle-tested, robust relational database for storing agent configurations, call logs, and user data securely. |

| **Infra**      | **Docker & Docker Compose**                   | **Reproducibility.** This is the magic that makes it all work. It packages every service and its dependencies into isolated containers for a flawless, one-command setup. |

### Prerequisites

1.  **Docker & Docker Compose:** You absolutely need this. [Get it here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
2.  **Git:** For cloning the repository. [Get it here](https://git-scm.com/).

### Installation & Launch

1.  **Clone the Project:**
    Open your terminal and clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-marketing-agents.git
    cd voice-marketing-agents
    ```

2.  **Launch the Mothership!**

    ```sh
    docker compose up --build -d
    ```

3.  **Download the LLM:**
    Now, tell the running Ollama service to pull our fast language model.
    ```sh
    # Pro-tip: Run 'docker ps' to see the exact container name if it differs.
    docker exec -it voice-marketing-agents-ollama-1 ollama pull tinylama
    ```

4.  **üéâ You're All Set! Explore Your New AI Platform:**
